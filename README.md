# File Comet

A quick way to share a single file over HTTP

## Purpose

Sometimes you just need to share a file quickly.

## Caveats

The method for sharing the file is *INSECURE*. The security being offered here is security through obscurity. If security is a true concern, you're better off using something else. Use this software at your own risk.
